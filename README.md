# grokDoc: a system to understand documents

This is the source code for different modules of grokDoc, a system to understand large and complex documents. 
The system is produced as an output of my thesis. 

## Dissertation Title: Understanding the Logical and Semantic Structure of Large Documents



**Necessary packages**:

1. Python 2.7 or higher
2. Tensorflow latest GPU 
3. Keras lastest 
4. Bokeh python
5. Skflow 
6. Scikit-learn 



Information: Following are the directories for different modules of the system


1. **Code**: Section classifiers using RNN

**Location**: section_header_rnn


2. **Code**: Section classifiers using CNN

**Location**: section_header_cnn


3. **Code**: Semantic section classifiers

**Location**: semantic_section_classifier


4. **Code**: Section sequencing classifers

**Location**: section_sequencing
